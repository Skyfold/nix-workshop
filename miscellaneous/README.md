# dirty-go-dev-setup

Often, when I first started using NixOS, I would question: "How do I
do the normal things I'm used to in NixOS with Nix?". Think, you have
some project you need to build and don't have the time to figure out
the proper Nix way or how Nixpkgs does things for that language. In
reality what you are asking is "how do I use nix-shell to setup my
environment?". This challenge is not about reproducibility, but
dealing with real world dirty setups.
